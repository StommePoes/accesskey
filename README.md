# accesskey
This is [a draft alternative specification](http://chaals.github.io/accesskey/index.src.html) for a proposed replacement for the accesskey section in HTML
Currently it is still getting worked up to the "starting point" - there are things I
plan to do before I think of it as at "version 0":
* ensure that you can use words as well as single characters
* ensure that user agents handle discovery of accesskeys
* allow naming keys plus modifiers

And then I will request that the [HTML accessibility Task Force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML) adopt
it as a draft replacement for what is in HTML at the moment

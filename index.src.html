  <section id="why"><h2>Rationale for this extension</h2>
    <p>The definition of <code>accesskey</code> in HTML5 is a clear improvement on the HTML 4 specification, for example allowing for multiple keys to cope with different user environments. However, there are still a number of problems:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Javascript shortcuts break user expectations</dt>
        <dd>Because implementation of <code>accesskey</code> in browsers has been of poor quality, for many years the most common approach to providing shortcuts has been to use javascript to trap user Interface events. This is <em>worse</em> than the problem it attempts to resolve: 
          <ul>
            <li>it interferes with normal user agent behaviour, unpleasantly surprising some users</li>
            <li>there is no discoverability mechanism for javascript-based activations. This is a particular problem when combining javascript libraries and/or browser extensions</li>
          </ul>Improving <code>accesskey</code> to the extent that it can easily replace the benefits of the javascript approach, while mitigating its drawbacks, is a major motivation for this extension.</dd>
      <dt>Conflict resolution</dt>
        <dd>The current specification allows the User Agent to determine  "what keys are available", from the author's suggested values for accesskey. However, its algorithm is too limiting, failing to take into account the point that the "first available key" may not be the one most appropriate for the user.</dd>
      <dt>Discoverability</dt>
        <dd>In the current HTML specification there is no requirement for discoverability. This is a major problem with existing implementations, very few of which provide a means for the user to discover that <code>accesskey</code>s have been assigned. Instead the current specification <strong>assumes</strong> that authors will somehow present the required information to the user. For a browser-mediated interaction, this is inappropriate, placing the burden of work in the wrong part of the "hierarchy of needs" and making it less likely to be done, or done effectively. While the HTML specification has rightly shied away from specifying user interfaces, it should at least be clear when there is a need for user interface if a functionality is going to work.</dd>
      <dt>Ecosystem requirements</dt>
        <dd>The current HTML specification assumes all shortcuts assigned will be key combinations. This does not meet the reality of deployed platforms, many of which either do not have a keyboard or also permit other activations more appropriate for a shortcut.</dd>
        <dd>In addition, the current HTML specification fails to provide sufficient context to motivate the use of a shortcut, including when it is not useful, or when another method may be more appropriate.</dd>

  <h2 id="proposal">Proposed Replacement Section 5.5:</h2>

  <section><h3 id="assigning-keyboard-shortcuts">5.5 Assigning keyboard shortcuts</h3>

  <section><h4 id="introduction-9">5.5.1 Introduction</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Some common browsing functions have multiple "shortcut" activations: going back in history, following a link or selecting an item in a form menu may be done through "pressing" an onscreen button, a keystroke, a gesture, or other command. Likewise, in many web apps, especially those that users interact with often such as webmail, applications for work, or common recreational sites, it is helpful to provide activation that minimises the amount of physical work a user needs to do. Typically, these are features remembered by frequent use, but it is important that users can discover them and that they meet the particular needs of a user, in order to be a genuine shortcut.</p>

  <p>HTML lets authors request shortcut activations for any element that can receive focus or be activated, using the <code id="introduction-9:the-accesskey-attribute"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute. Authors can provide several suggestions for shortcuts in the <code id="introduction-9:the-accesskey-attribute-3"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute.</p>

  <p class="note">It is not a good idea to provide shortcuts for normal browser function. Where HTML already provides a way to indicate something the browser can act on, such as using <code>rel="help"</code> to identify a link to a help interface, it is better to use these features than to assign an <code>accesskey</code> attribute.</p>

  <p class="issue">Currently the <code>rel</code> attribute only applies to <code>a</code>, <code>area</code>, and <code>link</code> elements. Should it be extended to cover e.g. elements with <code>role="link"</code> or interactive elements which can take on the functionalities of a link defined with <code>a role="…"</code>?</p>

  <p>The actual shortcut(s) assigned, such as a key combination or direct access voice command, is determined by the user agent, using information about the user's preferences, keyboard, what shortcuts exist on the platform, and what other shortcuts have been specified on the page, as well as the information provided in the <code id="introduction-9:the-accesskey-attribute-2"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute.</p>


  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, an author has provided a button and requested a shortcut activation. The author has suggested the russian word "<span lang="ru">Написать</span>", the latin keys "w" and "c", and the number "1" as useful hints for what makes sense as shortcut activations.</p>

   <pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="Написать" onclick="compose()"
       <strong>accesskey="Написать С W 1"</strong> id="Написать"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>A browser might apply this by adding a voice command "Написать" to a grammar of expected commands for which an event can be fired, by listening for keypresses of the Cyrillic letters "<span lang="ru">Н</span>" (equivalent to the latin "n") or "П" (equivalent to latin "P") or one of the letters proposed by the author, perhaps with a standard modifier.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The user agent is best-placed to inform the user that there are shortcut activations for the page, and explain the particular activation shortcuts and what they will do. But HTML also provides an <code>accessKeyLabel</code> DOM attribute, which is text created by the user agent describing the shortcut. Applications can use this to <strong>reinforce</strong> the information that a shortcut is available.</p>

  <div class="example">

    <p>To tell the user what the shortcut key is, this script explicitly adds the browser-described shortcut activation to the button's label:</p>

    <pre><code>function addShortcutKeyLabel(button) {
<strong>  if (button.accessKeyLabel != '')
    button.value += ' (' + button.accessKeyLabel + ')';</strong>
}
addShortcutKeyLabel(document.getElementById('c'));</code></pre>

    <p>Different browsers on different platforms can show different labels, even for the same key combination.For example, if the activation shortcut is the Control key, the Shift key, and the letter C, a Windows browser might display "<samp>Ctrl+Shift+C</samp>", whereas a Mac browser might display "<samp>^⇧C</samp>", and an Emacs browser might just display "<samp>C-C</samp>". Where a voice command enabled, the value might be "<samp>^⇧C or say "compose"</samp>.</p>

    <p class="issue">For gestures, it is useful to present an animation of the gesture. Can we enable this?</p>

    <p>It is therefore unwise to attempt to parse the value returned from the <code id="introduction-9:dom-accesskeylabel-2"><a href="#dom-accesskeylabel">accessKeyLabel</a></code> IDL attribute.</p>

  </div></section>


  <section><h4 id="the-accesskey-attribute">5.5.2 The <dfn><code>accesskey</code></dfn> attribute</h4>

    <p>All <a href="infrastructure.html#html-elements" id="the-accesskey-attribute:html-elements">HTML elements</a> may have the <code id="the-accesskey-attribute:the-accesskey-attribute"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code>
  content attribute set. The <code id="the-accesskey-attribute:the-accesskey-attribute-2"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute's value is used
  by the user agent as a guide for creating a shortcut that activates or focuses the
  element.</p>

    <p>If specified, the value must be an <a href="infrastructure.html#ordered-set-of-unique-space-separated-tokens" id="the-accesskey-attribute:ordered-set-of-unique-space-separated-tokens">ordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a>
  that are <a href="infrastructure.html#case-sensitive" id="the-accesskey-attribute:case-sensitive">case-sensitive</a>.</p>

    <p>Authors <em class="rfc2119">should</em> give a value to the accesskey attribute, for backward compatibility.</p>

  <div class="example">

    <p>In the following example, a set of links are given <code>accesskey</code>s so that users
   familiar with the site can quickly navigate to relevant pages:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a title="Consortium Activities" accesskey="Activity a" href="/Consortium/activities"&gt;Activities&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a title="Technical Reports and Recommendations" accesskey="TR" href="/TR/"&gt;Technical Reports&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a title="Alphabetical Site Index" accesskey="S" href="/Consortium/siteindex"&gt;Site Index&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a title="About This Site" accesskey="B" href="/Consortium/"&gt;About Consortium&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a title="Contact Consortium" accesskey="C" href="/Consortium/contact"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

    <p>In the following example, a search field is identified using the standard HTML technique <code>input type="search"</code>. A link to an advanced interface is available, but there is no standard HTML technique for identifying a "more advanced" version. Assuming that advanced search is a relatively common user interaction on this site, an <code>accesskey</code> attribute is present to request an activation shortcut, and the application has suggested three possible access keys, "advanced", "s" and "9" in that order. A user agent on a device with a "QWERTY" keyboard might pick the combination <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd> as the shortcut if it is available, first falling back to <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd> and then <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd></kbd>. A user agent on a small device with a telephone keypad might pick just the plain unadorned key <kbd>9</kbd>:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;form action="/search"&gt;
 &lt;label&gt;Search: &lt;input type="search" name="q"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;a href="advanced.html" accesskey="advanced s 9"
 &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

  </div>

  <p>User agents <em class="rfc2119">should</em> indicate whether a page has shortcuts assigned, and if so <em class="rfc2119">should</em> provide users with a list of the current shortcuts for a page. The <code id="introduction-9:dom-accesskeylabel"><a href="#dom-accesskeylabel">accessKeyLabel</a></code> IDL attribute returns a
  string representing the actual shortcut assigned by the user agent.</p>

  <p class="note">There are a variety of interaction strategies that could be used to meet this requirement. Opera 12, and Opera mini, enabled a menu that presented the activation shortcuts enabled and what they did. iCab and many old phone browsers added icons to the screen. The excesskey extension for Opera added an icon and menu to the browsers User Interface alerting users to the fact that shortcuts were enabled. Some screenreaders announce a shortcut verbally. This specification does not recommend a specific user interface, because that inherently depends on the nature of the user agent.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a button has possible access keys described. A script then tries to
   update the button's label to advertise the shortcut the user agent selected.</p>

   <pre><code>&lt;input id="compose" type=submit accesskey="N @ 1" title="write a new email message" value="Compose"&gt;
...
&lt;script&gt;
 function labelButton(button) {
   if (button.accessKeyLabel)
     button.value += ' (' + button.accessKeyLabel + ')';
 }
 var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName('input');
 for (var i = 0; i &lt; inputs.length; i += 1) {
   if (inputs[i].type == "submit")
     labelButton(inputs[i]);
 }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

   <p>On one user agent, the button's label might become "<samp>Compose (⌘N)</samp>". On another, it might become "<samp>Compose (Alt+⇧+1)</samp>". A voice interface, on user request for shortcuts, might state that a command is available called "compose", whose function is to "write a new email message". If the user agent doesn't assign a shortcut, it will be just "<samp>Compose</samp>". The exact string depends on what the user agent assigns as an activation shortcut, and how the user agent represents that shortcut.</p>

  </div></section>

  <section><h4 id="processing-model-7">5.5.3 Processing model</h4>

    <p>An element's <dfn id="assigned-access-key">assigned access key</dfn> is a user behaviour defined by the user agent. It is derived from the presence of an <a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute, and normallly takes into account content of that attribute.</p>

  <p>Whenever an element's <code id="processing-model-7:the-accesskey-attribute-2"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute is set, changed,
  or removed, the user agent must update the element's <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-2">assigned access key</a> by running
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol><li><p>If the element has no <code id="processing-model-7:the-accesskey-attribute-3"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> attribute, stop.
      <li>If the user agent has a stored user preference for activation of the element, then skip
   to the <i>fallback</i> step below.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, <a href="infrastructure.html#split-a-string-on-spaces" id="processing-model-7:split-a-string-on-spaces">split the attribute's value on
   spaces</a>, and let <var>keys</var> be the resulting tokens.</p></li><li>

    <p>For each value in <var>keys</var> in turn, in the order the tokens appeared in the
    attribute's value, run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>If the value does not correspond to a key on the system's keyboard, then skip the remainder of these steps for this value.</p></li>
     <li><p>If the user agent can find a mix of zero or more modifier keys that, combined with the key that corresponds to the value given in the attribute, can be used as the access key, then the user agent may assign that combination of keys as the element's <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-3">assigned access
     key</a> and abort these steps.
     <a href="introduction.html#fingerprinting-vector" id="processing-model-7:fingerprinting-vector" class="fingerprint" title="There is a potential fingerprinting vector here."><img alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" src="img/fingerprint.png" width="46" height="64"></a>
     </p></li></ol>

   </li><li><p><i>Fallback</i>: The user agent <em class="rfc2119">should</em> assign a key combination and/or other shortcut of its choosing as the element's <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-4">assigned access key</a> and then abort these steps.</p></li><li><p>If this step is reached, the element has no <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-5">assigned access key</a>.</p></li></ol>

  <p>Once a user agent has selected and assigned an access key for an element, the user agent should
  not change the element's <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-6">assigned access key</a> unless the <code id="processing-model-7:the-accesskey-attribute-4"><a href="#the-accesskey-attribute">accesskey</a></code> content attribute is changed or the element is moved to
  another <code id="processing-model-7:document"><a href="dom.html#document">Document</a></code>.</p>

  <p>When the user triggers the shortcut behaviour corresponding to the <a href="#assigned-access-key" id="processing-model-7:assigned-access-key-7">assigned access key</a>
  for an element, for example by pressing a shortcut key or key combination, if the element <a href="semantics.html#concept-command" id="processing-model-7:concept-command">defines a command</a>, the
  command's <a href="semantics.html#command-facet-hiddenstate" id="processing-model-7:command-facet-hiddenstate">Hidden State</a> facet is false (visible),
  the command's <a href="semantics.html#command-facet-disabledstate" id="processing-model-7:command-facet-disabledstate">Disabled State</a> facet is also false
  (enabled), the element is <a href="infrastructure.html#in-a-document" id="processing-model-7:in-a-document">in a <code>Document</code></a> that has an associated
  <a href="browsers.html#browsing-context" id="processing-model-7:browsing-context">browsing context</a>, and neither the element nor any of its ancestors has a <code id="processing-model-7:the-hidden-attribute"><a href="editing.html#the-hidden-attribute">hidden</a></code> attribute specified, then the user agent <em class="rfc2119">may</em> trigger the <a href="semantics.html#command-facet-action" id="processing-model-7:command-facet-action">Action</a> of the command.</p> 
  <p>Otherwise, if the element is "active" the user agent <em class="rfc2119">must</em> move the focus to the element with a corresponding assigned accesskey.</p>
